In c# you can use the *new* keyword ONLY for some specific methods called *constructors*: those are functions that have the following restrictions:

1) Got the same name as the Class that contains the function
2) Cannot be static
3) Cannot return any value

but what's the real **reason** to use a constructor? basically is to initialize an object with some specific properties and methods.

Those members are described in c# by the Class of the constructor we are calling.

Since in Javascript we don't have classes, this members can be described inside any function

    function Example() {
        this.intMember = 1;
        this.stringMember = 'abc';
        this.funcMember = function(addThisToIntMember) {
            this.intMember = this.intMember + addThisToIntMember;
        }
    }

to make a loose comparison, in Javascript a function can act **as both a Class and a Constructor at the same time**.

if you call a function with the *new* keyword, the following steps will be executed:
1) a object is created;
2) all the members described in the *prototype* property of the called function are copied to the new object;
3) the function is executed and the created object associated with the keyword *this* ([click here](/javascript-what-is-this) if this sounds weird)
4) returns the object;

translated in verbose code the *new* operator behaves like the following code:

    //this line
    var a = new Example();
    

    //has similar behaviour as this
    var b = Object.create(Example.prototype);
    Example.call(b);

**BEAR IN MIND** that I've used the word **SIMILAR**, not **EQUAL**. in fact there are some other logic under the hood: for example using the *new* keyword we can use the operator *instanceof* to identify if an object was created with a specific function as constructor:

    var a = new Example();
    var b = Object.create(Example.prototype);
    Example.call(b);

    console.log(a instanceof Example) //true;
    console.log(b instanceof Example) //false;
